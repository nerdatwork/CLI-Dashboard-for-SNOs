# CLI Dashboard for SNOs in Powershell

The current dashboard lacks many data points which lead me to write this code.

This dashboard has almost all of the details as shown on web dashboard.

<b>Step 1 </b>: Generate API key on Etherscan.io. It should be under https://etherscan.io/myapikey. Add this API key to `apikey.txt` file. DO NOT ADD any other text to the file besides API key.

<b>Step 2</b>: Make sure `apikey.txt` and `Nerdboard.ps1` are in the same directory.

<b>Step 3</b>: Run the powershell script through command line or by double clicking it.
